# H2O Demo for W2V

### This is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) demo to show the power of word embedding such as generated by the Word2vec algorithm.

It was designed as part of the development of this course (https://learn.mikegchambers.com/p/aws-machine-learning-specialty-certification-course) for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification. However its use is general, and it has been published here for the wider good.

As a courtesy please attribute this repository if you present this demo.

Pull requests very welcome.  Enjoy.
